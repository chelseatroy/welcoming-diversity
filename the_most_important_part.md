# The Most Important Part

## You don't have to understand someone to respect them

What if you don't understand *why* your colleague of a different gender behaves the way they do? What if you cannot imagine dating the kind of people that they date? 

**This is okay. You don't have to get it: you can respect someone else's life without having to understand it.**

No human is sub-human: all humans deserve respect. For example, you can do any of the following to demonstrate respect for other people, *regardless* of your differences:

* Listen to your colleagues when they speak—and do not interrupt them.
* Keep your mouth shut about decisions that have nothing to do with you—like your colleague's dating, dietary, or other personal choices.
* On work decisions, assume that your colleagues are capable people who make choices for valid reasons. 
* Acknowledge the validity of your colleague's position if you disagree: you can present your own case without invalidating someone else's case. In fact, when you re-state your colleague's case, you demonstrate to them that you listened to them, you give them the chance to fix any misunderstandings, and you make them more likely to listen to your side of the story. 
* If you notice your colleague in a situation that you think might make them uncomfortable, pull them aside after the fact and explain that you don't mean to pry, but you want to make sure that they are okay. If they are not okay, ask them if they would like *you* to address whatever made them uncomfortable. More on this in the next section.

## Why it's so helpful for you to know this stuff

*Maybe you do not fall into any of the categories that we have discussed.* Or maybe you fall into one of them, but not the others. Why is it important for you to know about how to interact with people who are different from you? 

**This is why:**

When someone *doesn't* know to ask a non-binary person for their preferred pronouns, when they *don't* know not to out their gay coworker to their other coworkers, when they *don't* know to consider the fact that men have more confidence in their abilities than women, the responsibility to educate them falls **on the transgender person, the gay person, the woman, et cetera, who got hurt by the outcome.**

Those conversations are a steaming heap of awkward. At best, someone gets embarrassed, and that's no fun for either party. At worst, someone get defensive and upset, and they riposte by insisting that this distinction they're being informed of doesn't really matter. That's even *less* fun for either party. 

But the non-binary person, gay person, or woman in these examples has to choose between the crappiness of always initiating the uncomfortable conversation and the crappiness of getting misgendered, outed, and discounted on job skills. 

*You, yes you,* can relieve some of this burden on your coworkers. 

You can do this because, by educating yourself about how to be inclusive, you make yourself *one less person* that they have to educate. 

But when you learn about, say, trans issues and you're **not** a trans person, you can do even better: you can *relieve* your coworkers of *always* being the ones to start the uncomfortable conversations.

You may never have to deal with the crappiness of getting misgendered. But you can choose to address the situation when others in your workplace misgender someone. **Often, the voices of people outside the marginalized group carry more weight than the voices of people inside it.** When men speak out in favor of feminism, people notice. When someone sticks up for someone else, people notice. And now, you have the ability to become one of those people whose voice people notice—and also impact your workplace in a very positive way.
