# The Most Important Part

## You don't have to understand someone to respect them

## Why it's so helpful for you to know this stuff

*Maybe you do not fall into any of the categories that we have discussed.* Or maybe you fall into one of them, but not the others. Why is it important for you to know about how to interact with people who are different from you? 

**This is why:**

When someone *doesn't* know to ask a non-binary person for their preferred pronouns, when they *don't* know not to out their gay coworker to their other coworkers, when they *don't* know to consider the fact that men have more confidence in their abilities than women, the responsibility to educate them falls **on the transgender person, the gay person, the woman, et cetera, who got hurt by the outcome.**

Those conversations are a steaming heap of awkward. At best, someone gets embarrassed, and that's no fun for either party. At worst, someone get defensive and upset, and they riposte by insisting that this distinction they're being informed of doesn't really matter. That's even *less* fun for either party. 

But the non-binary person, gay person, or woman in these examples has to choose between the crappiness of always initiating the uncomfortable conversation and the crappiness of getting misgendered, outed, and discounted on job skills. 

*You, yes you,* can relieve some of this burden on your coworkers. 

You can do this because, by educating yourself about how to be inclusive, you make yourself *one less person* that they have to educate. 

But when you learn about, say, trans issues and you're **not** a trans person, you can do even better: you can *relieve* your coworkers of *always* being the ones to start the uncomfortable conversations.

You may never have to deal with the crappiness of getting misgendered. But you can choose to address the situation when others in your workplace misgender someone. **Often, the voices of people outside the marginalized group carry more weight than the voices of people inside it.** When men speak out in favor of feminism, people notice. When someone sticks up for someone else, people notice. And now, you have the ability to become one of those people whose voice people noticeâ€”and also impact your workplace in a very positive way.
