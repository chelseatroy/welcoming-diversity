# On (Binary) Gender

**Let’s talk about men and women in the workplace.** Men and women behave differently in the workplace, and it’s valuable for you to understand those differences.

[Men tend to have more confidence in their abilities than women do](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/&sa=D&ust=1454345389628000&usg=AFQjCNGJJAe-t_xLz3-ba6brw5tKWa7Wiw). So women often undersell themselves, and men often oversell themselves. This results in major differences between how men and women’s careers progress.

Here’s an example of that in action: [women tend read the ‘required qualifications’ for a job as steadfast](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified&sa=D&ust=1454345389629000&usg=AFQjCNEztHAJCgjuKvtncH05Z23qH9VGGA) [rules](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified&sa=D&ust=1454345389630000&usg=AFQjCNEImYsehVZfb6oksZiw43rxLtyL6g)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified&sa=D&ust=1454345389630000&usg=AFQjCNEImYsehVZfb6oksZiw43rxLtyL6g) [while men view them more as](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified&sa=D&ust=1454345389630000&usg=AFQjCNEImYsehVZfb6oksZiw43rxLtyL6g) [suggestions](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified&sa=D&ust=1454345389631000&usg=AFQjCNGjY0ptVokYUIYNCZ-WiZcm85qvHA). So if a job description demands four years of experience, a man with two years of experience is more likely to apply than a woman who also has two years of experience. This different understanding about rules and requirements is partially a result of the way girls and boys are raised: disobedient girls are considered alarming and troubled, while disobedient boys get normalizing comments like ‘boys will be boys!’ As a result, males grow up with less regard for the rules than women do.

And it’s not just women themselves. Other people apply “the rules” more stringently to women than men. For example, men often get hired and promoted on potential to perform the job to which they are being promoted; women only get the same opportunity when their past demonstrated achievements prove that they can already fulfill the role.

This happens for a few reasons. First, [men tend to have more sponsors in the hiring process](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2010/09/why-men-still-get-more-promotions-than-women&sa=D&ust=1454345389634000&usg=AFQjCNFd6fjJHXYSGmHAfb7AyPqDk1smmA), so someone in power is speaking for their potential. When a woman doesn’t have this, she only gets promoted based on her past accomplishments. And if someone with a sponsor and someone without one are in contention for the same role, the role will more likely go to the person who has an advocate in the decision-making room.

Second, women have a harder time demonstrating their leadership capability than men because [assertive characteristics have a positive stigma for men](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.workforce.com/articles/20887-bossy-rants&sa=D&ust=1454345389636000&usg=AFQjCNEP3BDoQ5g6TNIcQBnqyLa7QVQIAA) (who get called ‘decisive’ and ‘worthy of leadership’) [and a negative stigma for women](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.workforce.com/articles/20887-bossy-rants&sa=D&ust=1454345389637000&usg=AFQjCNHoN7SxdXFDuOWmId6vhsLOlXJJ8A) (who get called ‘bossy’ or ‘bitchy.’)

Third, [we have an inherent, negative reaction when we perceive a woman as seeking power](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://gap.hks.harvard.edu/price-power-power-seeking-and-backlash-against-female-politicians&sa=D&ust=1454345389638000&usg=AFQjCNGDB55rUoIT-ZkYsJOxNCySWHpOOw). That negative reaction affects our behavior when making promotion decisions. We do not have the same negative reaction when we observe power-seeking behavior in men.

It is commonly believed that men get promotions and raises more often than women because they ask for them more often. This would indicate that women should ask more often. There are two problems with this.

First of all, this is not as true as we thought. [Among a sample of 3,000 men and women who both asked for raises and promotions](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/myth-ideal-worker-does-doing-all-right-things-really-get-women-ahead&sa=D&ust=1454345389639000&usg=AFQjCNFlcrs2FzigGsOA82C8e3q28hq1gA) with approximately equal frequency over a 10 year period, women still received less.   

Second of all, the misconception that men ask for more suggests that the solution to sexism in the workplace is for women to “act more like men.” This suggests that women being from different from men is the problem. It says, “we want diverse people provided that they all think and act exactly the same way.” **We want people to think differently in the workplace; that’s why diversity is so important in the first place.**

Specifically, asking women to act more like men denies the value of the strengths and abilities that women bring to the table, including listening abilities, empathy, nurturing abilities, and collaborative abilities. By asking women to “act more like men,” we are asking them to do one of two things:

1.  We are asking them to abandon the skills that make them different from, and valuable alongside, their male colleagues, to instead become more like their male colleagues. This misses the point of having a diverse staff to begin with.
2.  Otherwise, we are asking them to keep the abilities that make them different from their male colleagues, and also possess  a second, more “male” set of abilities. So we ask them to be nurturing and confident, empathetic and aggressive, collaborative and...and...and. We do not ask men to do this (or, at least, that we do not require them to do this before we hire, recognize, and promote them). So it’s not fair.

Instead of asking women to act more like men, it makes sense for a manager or director to learn why and how “feminine” abilities are valuable to the business and look for opportunities to apply those skills, rather than defaulting to “assertiveness” and professed knowledgeability as the primary metrics of a person’s value. By doing so, a manager takes advantage of his team’s latent strengths—[and the results improve the bottom line for the business](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.forbes.com/sites/womensmedia/2012/05/07/a-balance-of-both-masculine-and-feminine-strengths-the-bottom-line-benefit/&sa=D&ust=1454345389649000&usg=AFQjCNFo0n6IPciD4_Dov5QfLCyNdn0qZg).
