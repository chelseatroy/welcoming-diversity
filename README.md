On (Binary) Gender


Transgender Colleagues

What does it mean to be transgender? If someone is transitioning from male to female, she was not born a man that is now becoming a woman. [She was born a](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.ted.com/7-talks-on-the-transgender-experience/&sa=D&ust=1454345389651000&usg=AFQjCNFjBleOVtz2-CY6SQsuNKy6HVa2TA) [woman](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.ted.com/7-talks-on-the-transgender-experience/&sa=D&ust=1454345389651000&usg=AFQjCNFjBleOVtz2-CY6SQsuNKy6HVa2TA)[, and has always been a](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.ted.com/7-talks-on-the-transgender-experience/&sa=D&ust=1454345389652000&usg=AFQjCNFMFvj1qAs2vKJ5LqPmUx9YdFA1Lg) [woman](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.ted.com/7-talks-on-the-transgender-experience/&sa=D&ust=1454345389652000&usg=AFQjCNFMFvj1qAs2vKJ5LqPmUx9YdFA1Lg)[, assigned male at birth.](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.ted.com/7-talks-on-the-transgender-experience/&sa=D&ust=1454345389653000&usg=AFQjCNGGT4bvD62ObYGKF6u6XdxalEoBwg) The same goes for transgender men. These individuals often grow up feeling, at their core, wrong about the gender that others see them to be. They transition into the gender role that represents who they are and that has always felt right to them.

When your transgender colleague asks to be addressed with specific pronouns, use those pronouns. If you are not sure which pronouns to use, ask the person you are addressing—not someone else. If your colleague changes his or her name, refer to him or her by his or her chosen name. Do not make references to his or her previous name, or talk about ‘back when [so and so] was [different gender].’  Do not ask questions about hormones, surgeries[^b], or sex parts. Just like cisgender people, transgender people have a right to privacy when it comes to their bodies. Your colleague’s body is no one else’s business unless he or she chooses to discuss it.

If your colleague comes out to you as transgender (either pre-transition or post-transition), do not share this with other people. Your colleague’s history (or current experience) of transitioning genders is personal, and it is his or hers to share if and when he/she chooses to.

Non-Binary/Intersex/Agender Colleagues

Just as some people grow up feeling that they’ve been placed in the wrong body for their gender, others grow up feeling that they do not belong to a gender, or that they belong to both, or somewhere in between.

Use those pronouns that your colleague asks you to use. Your colleague might go by he/she, or both, or neither. Your colleague might go by ‘they.’ ([It is grammatically correct and appropriate to use ‘they’ to refer to a singular human](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.wsj.com/articles/can-they-be-accepted-as-a-singular-pronoun-1428686651&sa=D&ust=1454345389660000&usg=AFQjCNGwbHV91VMraUuAvEqVQF_HeO0pYw)). Your colleague might go by [“it” or “yo” or “zir/zey.”](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://pronoun.is/&sa=D&ust=1454345389661000&usg=AFQjCNEAR-GYWfRPsJschb-ScsLjxHY96Q) 

Your colleague may present as male or female and still identify as non-binary/agender/intersex. Just because someone “looks female” does not give you license to refer to them as such. If you are not sure which pronouns to use, ask the person you are addressing—not someone else. Again, do not ask questions about sex parts. If your colleague changes their name, refer to them by their chosen name.

So your coworker came out to you as gay.

Cool! We know you’re excited, but please do not run and tell your other coworker.

A person’s orientation is personal information: this means that it should be their decision who knows about it and when. People have lots of reasons for not fully “coming out.” The fact that you know someone’s orientation is not a license to broadcast it.

If you are not certain about your colleague’s orientation: do not ask. It is none of your business. This is different from pronouns. We do ask about the pronouns because, at work, we want to refer to people in a way that lines up with their identities. By contrast, at work, our colleague’s sexualities are never relevant to our projects.

But what if I want to date my colleague? Ask your colleague on a date. No need to ask for sexual orientation.

Keep in mind that “coming out” is not a one time thing that somebody does and then it’s over: they will have to come out repeatedly and continuously over the course of their lives because people will almost always assume straightness without further information. This is exhausting, and sometimes it’s more complicated than you assume. It is helpful for allies like you to be cognizant of this.

Also, don’t use the word ‘gay’ to describe inanimate objects in a negative way. This is an outdated use of the word, and it is insulting to gay people.

There are other orientations, too.

They include bisexuality, pansexuality, polysexuality, asexuality, and others. You don’t have to know them: the point is, sexuality and romanticism are far more fluid and far more varied than just a “straight” bucket and a “gay” bucket. Not everybody fits in one of those buckets. Sexual orientation isn’t really a matter of buckets.

Your colleague is not a novelty object with a “weird” orientation: your colleague is a normal human being just like you whose orientation is perhaps different from yours. This is okay: you don’t have to understand their orientation. You just treat them exactly as you would treat anyone on the team.

Different people have different preferences around labels. A label that one person uses as a neutral description of themselves may be an insult to another person (e.g. "queer"). Avoid using terms with a history of use as slurs in the workplace.

Here are a few choice resources that you can look at as much (or as little) as you like.

[It’s Pronounced Metrosexual](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/&sa=D&ust=1454345389673000&usg=AFQjCNFdPOgKazza5iKdNTaGZYUiOxmtyQ): This blog focuses on the generalities and the nuances of sex, gender, and sexual orientation in much greater detail than we have here. It’s funny, interesting, and safe for work. All of this author’s writing is freely available—including his books.

It looks at codes of conduct, intersectional movements, and more. And it looks at several different segments of the tech industry, from gaming to DJing to social networks.

[Can Empathy Scale to the Internet?](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/@sanspoint/can-empathy-scale-to-the-internet-3fd71acc917a%23.7dywgv2fi&sa=D&ust=1454345389675000&usg=AFQjCNEoAr43uKHuhTjtaSlFBmKn7Kt2Bw) A great piece on empathy in the digital age, with some relevant links. A good overall approach to thinking about online empathy, both for victims and for perpetrators.

This is really well phrased paragraph

Suggestion: also probably don't ask questions about hormones. Also don't treat transgender colleagues as goto sources for information in general about trans identity, transition, etc.; Google exists and many trans people resent being pushed into this role.
