On (Binary) Gender

Let’s talk about men and women in the workplace. Men and women behave differently in the workplace, and it’s valuable for you to understand those differences.

[Men tend to have more confidence in their abilities than women do](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/&sa=D&ust=1454345389628000&usg=AFQjCNGJJAe-t_xLz3-ba6brw5tKWa7Wiw). So women often undersell themselves, and men often oversell themselves. This results in major differences between how men and women’s careers progress.

Here’s an example of that in action: [women tend read the ‘required qualifications’ for a job as steadfast](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified&sa=D&ust=1454345389629000&usg=AFQjCNEztHAJCgjuKvtncH05Z23qH9VGGA) [rules](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified&sa=D&ust=1454345389630000&usg=AFQjCNEImYsehVZfb6oksZiw43rxLtyL6g)[,](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified&sa=D&ust=1454345389630000&usg=AFQjCNEImYsehVZfb6oksZiw43rxLtyL6g) [while men view them more as](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified&sa=D&ust=1454345389630000&usg=AFQjCNEImYsehVZfb6oksZiw43rxLtyL6g) [suggestions](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified&sa=D&ust=1454345389631000&usg=AFQjCNGjY0ptVokYUIYNCZ-WiZcm85qvHA). So if a job description demands four years of experience, a man with two years of experience is more likely to apply than a woman who also has two years of experience. This different understanding about rules and requirements is partially a result of the way girls and boys are raised: disobedient girls are considered alarming and troubled, while disobedient boys get normalizing comments like ‘boys will be boys!’ As a result, males grow up with less regard for the rules than women do.

And it’s not just women themselves. Other people apply “the rules” more stringently to women than men. For example, men often get hired and promoted on potential to perform the job to which they are being promoted; women only get the same opportunity when their past demonstrated achievements prove that they can already fulfill the role.

This happens for a few reasons. First, [men tend to have more sponsors in the hiring process](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hbr.org/2010/09/why-men-still-get-more-promotions-than-women&sa=D&ust=1454345389634000&usg=AFQjCNFd6fjJHXYSGmHAfb7AyPqDk1smmA), so someone in power is speaking for their potential. When a woman doesn’t have this, she only gets promoted based on her past accomplishments. And if someone with a sponsor and someone without one are in contention for the same role, the role will more likely go to the person who has an advocate in the decision-making room.

Second, women have a harder time demonstrating their leadership capability than men because [assertive characteristics have a positive stigma for men](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.workforce.com/articles/20887-bossy-rants&sa=D&ust=1454345389636000&usg=AFQjCNEP3BDoQ5g6TNIcQBnqyLa7QVQIAA) (who get called ‘decisive’ and ‘worthy of leadership’) [and a negative stigma for women](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.workforce.com/articles/20887-bossy-rants&sa=D&ust=1454345389637000&usg=AFQjCNHoN7SxdXFDuOWmId6vhsLOlXJJ8A) (who get called ‘bossy’ or ‘bitchy.’)

Third, [we have an inherent, negative reaction when we perceive a woman as seeking power](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://gap.hks.harvard.edu/price-power-power-seeking-and-backlash-against-female-politicians&sa=D&ust=1454345389638000&usg=AFQjCNGDB55rUoIT-ZkYsJOxNCySWHpOOw). That negative reaction affects our behavior when making promotion decisions. We do not have the same negative reaction when we observe power-seeking behavior in men.

It is commonly believed that men get promotions and raises more often than women because they ask for them more often. This would indicate that women should ask more often. There are two problems with this.

First of all, this is not as true as we thought. [Among a sample of 3,000 men and women who both asked for raises and promotions](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/myth-ideal-worker-does-doing-all-right-things-really-get-women-ahead&sa=D&ust=1454345389639000&usg=AFQjCNFlcrs2FzigGsOA82C8e3q28hq1gA) with approximately equal frequency over a 10 year period, women still received less.   

Second of all, the misconception that men ask for more suggests that the solution to sexism in the workplace is for women to “act more like men.” This suggests that women being from different from men is the problem. It says, “we want diverse people provided that they all think and act exactly the same way.” We want people to think differently in the workplace; that’s why diversity is so important in the first place.[^a]

Specifically, asking women to act more like men denies the value of the strengths and abilities that women bring to the table, including listening abilities, empathy, nurturing abilities, and collaborative abilities. By asking women to “act more like men,” we are asking them to do one of two things:

1.  We are asking them to abandon the skills that make them different from, and valuable alongside, their male colleagues, to instead become more like their male colleagues. This misses the point of having a diverse staff to begin with.
2.  Otherwise, we are asking them to keep the abilities that make them different from their male colleagues, and also possess  a second, more “male” set of abilities. So we ask them to be nurturing and confident, empathetic and aggressive, collaborative and...and...and. We do not ask men to do this (or, at least, that we do not require them to do this before we hire, recognize, and promote them). So it’s not fair.

Instead of asking women to act more like men, it makes sense for a manager or director to learn why and how “feminine” abilities are valuable to the business and look for opportunities to apply those skills, rather than defaulting to “assertiveness” and professed knowledgeability as the primary metrics of a person’s value. By doing so, a manager takes advantage of his team’s latent strengths—[and the results improve the bottom line for the business](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.forbes.com/sites/womensmedia/2012/05/07/a-balance-of-both-masculine-and-feminine-strengths-the-bottom-line-benefit/&sa=D&ust=1454345389649000&usg=AFQjCNFo0n6IPciD4_Dov5QfLCyNdn0qZg).

Transgender Colleagues

What does it mean to be transgender? If someone is transitioning from male to female, she was not born a man that is now becoming a woman. [She was born a](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.ted.com/7-talks-on-the-transgender-experience/&sa=D&ust=1454345389651000&usg=AFQjCNFjBleOVtz2-CY6SQsuNKy6HVa2TA) [woman](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.ted.com/7-talks-on-the-transgender-experience/&sa=D&ust=1454345389651000&usg=AFQjCNFjBleOVtz2-CY6SQsuNKy6HVa2TA)[, and has always been a](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.ted.com/7-talks-on-the-transgender-experience/&sa=D&ust=1454345389652000&usg=AFQjCNFMFvj1qAs2vKJ5LqPmUx9YdFA1Lg) [woman](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.ted.com/7-talks-on-the-transgender-experience/&sa=D&ust=1454345389652000&usg=AFQjCNFMFvj1qAs2vKJ5LqPmUx9YdFA1Lg)[, assigned male at birth.](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://blog.ted.com/7-talks-on-the-transgender-experience/&sa=D&ust=1454345389653000&usg=AFQjCNGGT4bvD62ObYGKF6u6XdxalEoBwg) The same goes for transgender men. These individuals often grow up feeling, at their core, wrong about the gender that others see them to be. They transition into the gender role that represents who they are and that has always felt right to them.

When your transgender colleague asks to be addressed with specific pronouns, use those pronouns. If you are not sure which pronouns to use, ask the person you are addressing—not someone else. If your colleague changes his or her name, refer to him or her by his or her chosen name. Do not make references to his or her previous name, or talk about ‘back when [so and so] was [different gender].’  Do not ask questions about hormones, surgeries[^b], or sex parts. Just like cisgender people, transgender people have a right to privacy when it comes to their bodies. Your colleague’s body is no one else’s business unless he or she chooses to discuss it.

If your colleague comes out to you as transgender (either pre-transition or post-transition), do not share this with other people. Your colleague’s history (or current experience) of transitioning genders is personal, and it is his or hers to share if and when he/she chooses to.

Non-Binary/Intersex/Agender Colleagues

Just as some people grow up feeling that they’ve been placed in the wrong body for their gender, others grow up feeling that they do not belong to a gender, or that they belong to both, or somewhere in between.

Use those pronouns that your colleague asks you to use. Your colleague might go by he/she, or both, or neither. Your colleague might go by ‘they.’ ([It is grammatically correct and appropriate to use ‘they’ to refer to a singular human](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.wsj.com/articles/can-they-be-accepted-as-a-singular-pronoun-1428686651&sa=D&ust=1454345389660000&usg=AFQjCNGwbHV91VMraUuAvEqVQF_HeO0pYw)). Your colleague might go by [“it” or “yo” or “zir/zey.”](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://pronoun.is/&sa=D&ust=1454345389661000&usg=AFQjCNEAR-GYWfRPsJschb-ScsLjxHY96Q) 

Your colleague may present as male or female and still identify as non-binary/agender/intersex. Just because someone “looks female” does not give you license to refer to them as such. If you are not sure which pronouns to use, ask the person you are addressing—not someone else. Again, do not ask questions about sex parts. If your colleague changes their name, refer to them by their chosen name.

So your coworker came out to you as gay.

Cool! We know you’re excited, but please do not run and tell your other coworker.

A person’s orientation is personal information: this means that it should be their decision who knows about it and when. People have lots of reasons for not fully “coming out.” The fact that you know someone’s orientation is not a license to broadcast it.

If you are not certain about your colleague’s orientation: do not ask. It is none of your business. This is different from pronouns. We do ask about the pronouns because, at work, we want to refer to people in a way that lines up with their identities. By contrast, at work, our colleague’s sexualities are never relevant to our projects.

But what if I want to date my colleague? Ask your colleague on a date. No need to ask for sexual orientation.

Keep in mind that “coming out” is not a one time thing that somebody does and then it’s over: they will have to come out repeatedly and continuously over the course of their lives because people will almost always assume straightness without further information. This is exhausting, and sometimes it’s more complicated than you assume. It is helpful for allies like you to be cognizant of this.

Also, don’t use the word ‘gay’ to describe inanimate objects in a negative way. This is an outdated use of the word, and it is insulting to gay people.

There are other orientations, too.

They include bisexuality, pansexuality, polysexuality, asexuality, and others. You don’t have to know them: the point is, sexuality and romanticism are far more fluid and far more varied than just a “straight” bucket and a “gay” bucket. Not everybody fits in one of those buckets. Sexual orientation isn’t really a matter of buckets.

Your colleague is not a novelty object with a “weird” orientation: your colleague is a normal human being just like you whose orientation is perhaps different from yours. This is okay: you don’t have to understand their orientation. You just treat them exactly as you would treat anyone on the team.

Different people have different preferences around labels. A label that one person uses as a neutral description of themselves may be an insult to another person (e.g. "queer"). Avoid using terms with a history of use as slurs in the workplace.

A good overall approach to thinking about online empathy, both for victims and for perpetrators.

This is really well phrased paragraph

Suggestion: also probably don't ask questions about hormones. Also don't treat transgender colleagues as goto sources for information in general about trans identity, transition, etc.; Google exists and many trans people resent being pushed into this role.
