##Contribution

Contributions to this document are welcome! In fact, contributions on racial and ethnic diversity would be especially welcome.

You can contribute in two ways:

1. Fork and pull request
2. If you are not a git/programmer person, drop a note introducing yourself and what you would like to do. This document is hosted on Gitbook.io, which is like a text editor for git repos. Gitbook.io allows multiple contributors (like you!) to be invited to edit the document.
