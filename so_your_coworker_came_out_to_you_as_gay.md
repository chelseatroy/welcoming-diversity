# So your Coworker Came Out to you as Gay.

**Cool! We know you’re excited, but please do not run and tell your other coworker.**

A person’s orientation is personal information: this means that it should be their decision who knows about it and when. People have lots of reasons for not fully “coming out.” The fact that you know someone’s orientation is not a license to broadcast it.

If you are not certain about your colleague’s orientation: **do not ask.** It is none of your business. This is different from pronouns. We *do* ask about the pronouns because, at work, we want to refer to people in a way that lines up with their identities. By contrast, at work, our colleague’s sexualities are never relevant to our projects.

*But what if I want to date my colleague?* Ask your colleague on a date. No need to ask for sexual orientation.

Keep in mind that “coming out” is not a one time thing that somebody does and then it’s over: they will have to come out repeatedly and continuously over the course of their lives because people will almost always assume straightness without further information. This is exhausting, and sometimes it’s more complicated than you assume. It is helpful for allies like you to be cognizant of this.

Also, don’t use the word ‘gay’ to describe inanimate objects in a negative way. This is an outdated use of the word, and it is insulting to gay people.

##There are other orientations, too.

They include bisexuality, pansexuality, polysexuality, asexuality, and others. You don’t have to know them: the point is, sexuality and romanticism are far more fluid and far more varied than just a “straight” bucket and a “gay” bucket. Not everybody fits in one of those buckets. Sexual orientation isn’t really a matter of buckets.

Your colleague is not a novelty object with a “weird” orientation: your colleague is a normal human being just like you whose orientation is perhaps different from yours. This is okay: you don’t have to understand their orientation. You just treat them exactly as you would treat anyone on the team.

Different people have different preferences around labels. A label that one person uses as a neutral description of themselves may be an insult to another person (e.g. "queer"). Avoid using terms with a history of use as slurs in the workplace.
